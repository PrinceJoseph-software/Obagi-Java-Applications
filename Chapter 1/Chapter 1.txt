1.2 Fill in the blanks (Java Environment)
a) The java command from the JDK executes a Java application.
b) The javac command from the JDK compiles a Java program.
c) A Java source code file must end with the .java file extension.
d) When a Java program is compiled, the file produced by the compiler ends with the .class file extension.
e) The file produced by the Java compiler contains bytecodes that are executed by the Java Virtual Machine.


1.3 Fill in the blanks (Object-Oriented Concepts)
a) Objects enable the design practice of information hiding—although they may know how to communicate with one another across well-defined interfaces, they normally are not allowed to know how other objects are implemented.
b) Java programmers concentrate on creating classes, which contain fields and the set of methods that manipulate those fields and provide services to clients.
c) The process of analyzing and designing a system from an object-oriented point of view is called object-oriented design (OOD).
d) A new class of objects can be created conveniently by inheritance—the new class (called the subclass) starts with the characteristics of an existing class (called the superclass), possibly customizing them and adding unique characteristics of its own.
e) Unified Modeling Language (UML) is a graphical language that allows people who design software systems to use an industry-standard notation to represent them.
f) The size, shape, color, and weight of an object are considered attributes of the object’s class.



1.4 Fill in the blanks (Computer Hardware & Software)
a) The logical unit that receives information from outside the computer for use by the computer is the input unit.
b) The process of instructing the computer to solve a problem is called programming.
c) Assembly language is a type of computer language that uses English-like abbreviations for machine-language instructions.
d) Output unit is a logical unit that sends information, which has already been processed by the computer, to various devices so that it may be used outside the computer.
e) Primary storage (main memory) and secondary storage are logical units of the computer that retain information.
f) Arithmetic and logic unit (ALU) is a logical unit of the computer that performs calculations.
g) Arithmetic and logic unit (ALU) is a logical unit of the computer that makes logical decisions.
h) High-level languages are most convenient to the programmer for writing programs quickly and easily.
i) The only language a computer can directly understand is that computer’s machine language.
j) Central processing unit (CPU) is a logical unit of the computer that coordinates the activities of all the other logical units.



1.5 Fill in the blanks (Programming & Networking)
a) The Java programming language is now used to develop large-scale enterprise applications, to enhance the functionality of web servers, to provide applications for consumer devices, and for many other purposes.
b) C initially became widely known as the development language of the UNIX operating system.
c) The Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) ensures that messages, consisting of sequentially numbered pieces called bytes, are properly routed from sender to receiver, arrive intact, and are assembled in the correct order.
d) The C++ programming language was developed by Bjarne Stroustrup in the early 1980s at Bell Laboratories.


1.6 Fill in the blanks (Java Program Execution)
a) Java programs normally go through five phases—edit, compile, load, verify, and execute.
b) A(n) Integrated Development Environment (IDE) provides many tools that support the software development process, such as editors for writing and editing programs, debuggers for locating logic errors in programs, and many other features.
c) The command java invokes the Java Virtual Machine (JVM), which executes Java programs.
d) A(n) virtual machine is a software application that simulates a computer but hides the underlying operating system and hardware from the programs that interact with it.
e) The class loader takes the .class files containing the program’s bytecodes and transfers them to primary memory.
f) The bytecode verifier examines bytecodes to ensure that they’re valid.


1.7 Explain the Two Compilation Phases of Java Programs
Java programs are compiled in two main phases:
1)Source Code Compilation:
The Java compiler (javac) translates .java files (source code) into bytecode (a .class file).
Bytecode is an intermediate representation, not specific to any computer.


2)Bytecode Execution:
The Java Virtual Machine (JVM) reads the compiled bytecode and translates it into machine code that the specific computer can understand.
The Just-In-Time (JIT) compiler may further optimize performance by translating frequently used bytecodes into native machine code.


1.8 - Applying Object-Oriented Concepts to a Wristwatch

1)Object: A wristwatch itself is an object because it is a tangible entity that has specific attributes and behaviors.

2)Attributes: These are the properties of the watch, such as size, shape, color, brand, type (analog/digital), battery life, etc.

3)Behaviors: These are the actions a watch can perform, such as displaying time, setting an alarm, changing modes, or showing a stopwatch.

4)Class: A blueprint that defines the general characteristics of all wristwatches. If you were to write a program, you might create a Wristwatch class containing attributes (color, brand, etc.) and methods (showTime(), setAlarm()).

5)Inheritance: Some watches extend the features of basic watches. For example, an alarm clock watch is a subclass of Wristwatch that adds new behaviors like setting an alarm.

6)Modeling: When designing software for watches, developers create a model that represents how the object functions in the real world.

7)Messages: In OOP, objects communicate by sending messages to each other. A smartwatch might send a message to a phone to update notifications.

8)Encapsulation: The internal working of the watch (e.g., how time is calculated) is hidden from the user. You only interact with the buttons and display.

9)Interface: The watch provides an interface like buttons or a touchscreen for users to interact with it.

Information Hiding: The internal mechanisms of the watch (such as quartz movement or digital circuitry) are hidden from the user, allowing them to only access necessary functionalities.
